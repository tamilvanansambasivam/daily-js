    <h1>The Foundations Are Math and Logic</h1>
    <p>
        The ultimate foundation are mathematics and logic. If you understand logic and mathematics, then you have the
        basis for understanding the scientific method. Once you understand the scientific method, then you can
        understand how to separate truth from falsehood in other fields and other things that youâ€™re reading.
